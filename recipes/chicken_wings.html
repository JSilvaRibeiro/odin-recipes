  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 lbs chicken wings, split at joints, tips removed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder (not baking soda)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>
      Optional: Your favorite wing sauce for tossing (e.g., buffalo sauce,
      barbecue sauce)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. In
      a bowl, mix baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Toss the wings in the
      dry mixture, ensuring even coating.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat your air fryer to 400째F (200째C).</li>
    <li>
      Arrange the wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket, leaving space
      between each wing. Cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping the wings halfway
      through, until they are golden brown and crispy.
    </li>
    <li>
      For an extra crispy finish, increase the temperature to 425째F (220째C) and
      air fry for an additional 5-7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you like saucy wings, toss the crispy wings in your favorite wing sauce
      in a bowl. Ensure each wing is coated evenly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Plate the wings and serve them hot. Pair with your preferred dipping sauce
      and enjoy your crispy air fryer chicken wings!
