  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <h4>For the butter:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
    <li>Slice the top off the garlic head to expose the cloves.</li>
    <li>
      Drizzle oil over the cloves, sprinkle on salt, wrap in aluminum foil.
    </li>
    <li>Bake for 45 minutes to an hour until cloves are soft and golden.</li>
    <li>Allow garlic to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>
      Blend garlic, softened butter (salt if needed), and dried herbs in a bowl
      with a spatula.
    </li>
    <li>
      Form butter into a log on plastic wrap, roll tightly, and refrigerate to
      firm up.
    </li>
    <li>This can be done a day in advance to allow flavors to marry.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>For the Steak:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The night before, liberally salt the steak and place it on a baking rack
      over a plate, uncovered in your refrigerator.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking, pat dry, rub
      with oil, and season with pepper to your taste.
    </li>
    <li>Pre-heat grill to high if using gas or prepare coals.</li>
    <li>
      Grill the steak for 4-5 minutes per side for a medium-rare preparation
      (internal temp of 135 degrees).
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove steak from grill, tent with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 5
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Slice garlic butter into 1/4 inch rounds and add the desired amount on top
      of the steak. Enjoy! (2-3 rounds per steak works well.)
